Install Nagios 4.4.3 on Ubuntu 18.04:
=====================================

Nagios is one of the most widely used open source monitoring tool for monitoring the services and application that run’s on Windows and Linux. It also has the capability to monitor routers and other network devices.With the help of Nagios, you can monitor basic services and attributes. We can access the Nagios using web interface coming with the bundle, but the configurations need to be done on the file level.

Services List:
Nagios can monitor your “private” services and attributes of Linux/UNIX servers, such as:

Attributes
	CPU load
	Memory usage
	Disk usage
	Logged in users
	Running processes
	
Private Services
	HTTP
	FTP
	SSH
	SMTP

Prerequisites:
==============
Let’s switch to the root user.
	sudo su -

Before compiling the Nagios from the source, you would need to install dependent packages for Nagios. Update the repository cache and install the dependencies for Nagios.
	apt-get update
	apt-get install build-essential apache2 php openssl perl make php-gd libgd-dev libapache2-mod-php libperl-dev libssl-dev daemon wget apache2-utils unzip

Create nagios user and nagcmd group (allowing the external commands to be executed through the web interface), add the nagios and apache user to the part of the nagcmd group.
	useradd nagios
	groupadd nagcmd
	usermod -a -G nagcmd nagios
	usermod -a -G nagcmd www-data

Install Nagios Core
You can use below commands to download Nagios core (v4.4.3). Else, you can visit the official website to download the latest version of Nagios core.
	cd /tmp
	wget https://assets.nagios.com/downloads/nagioscore/releases/nagios-4.4.3.tar.gz
	tar -zxvf /tmp/nagios-4.4.3.tar.gz
	cd /tmp/nagios-4.4.3/
	
Perform the below steps to compile the Nagios from the source code.

	make install-init
	make install-config
	make install-commandmode

Configure Nagios:
=================
The installer has now placed configuration files in the /usr/local/nagios/etc directory. These default configuration files should work fine for now to start Nagios.  All you need to make just one change before you proceed.
Edit the /usr/local/nagios/etc/objects/contacts.cfg file and change the email address associated with the nagiosadmin contact definition to the address you’d like to use for receiving alerts.

	vi /usr/local/nagios/etc/objects/contacts.cfg

Change the email address field to receive the notification.	
	define contact{
        contact_name                    nagiosadmin             ; Short name of user
        use                             generic-contact         ; Inherit default values from generic-contact template (defined above)
        alias                           Nagios Admin            ; Full name of user
        email                           kumar.vikas@gmail.com   ; <<***** CHANGE THIS TO YOUR EMAIL ADDRESS ******
             }

Run the following command.
	a2enmod cgi
